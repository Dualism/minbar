GPrayer is a Gnome prayer times application on top of libitl, with athan
sound playback and notifications etc.

It is still under heavy development.

To build, you need: libglade
                    libitl
                    libgtk
                    gconf 
                    gstreamer-0.10

the build file builds the program. It works on my system, you may have
to modify it for yours.

When you go to your distribution's package installation mechanism to get
the needed libraries, make sure you fetch the development files
