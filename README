GPrayer is a Gnome islamic prayer times application on top of libitl, the
Arabeyes prayer calculation library, it features athan sound playback 
and notifications.

After installing it, you are responsible of configuring it correctly
with your location, time zone and Madhab details, so you get the
correct salat times.

BUILDING
--------

You need a few libraries to build from source, on debian/ubuntu
these are:

gnome-common
automake1.9 
libitl-dev
gettext
libgconf2-dev
libgtk2.0-dev  
libglade2-dev 
libgstreamer0.10-dev 
libnotify-dev

I think the rest should be installed by default on all linux 
ditributions, if not, please let me know.

build procedure:
./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install


If you build it successfully I would love to know about that,
so I post what is needed for your particular distribution.
